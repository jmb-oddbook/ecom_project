## Part 2 -- Tidying the tables
With comments see read_in.ipynb.

I really should have deleted the "total_sale" on the invoice table as that is a calculated value, but for the project I don't think we are allowed to delete data. Move about and modify yes but not delete.

## Part 3 -- Feed the database and do some SQL queries

## Part 4 -- Back to Python and Jupyter
Do some exploratory data anaylsis with the sales database.<br />
Was able to reuse some code that I used for cleaning the data to feed into an SQLite database.

## Part 5 -- Visualisations
Currently in the works.

## Part 6 -- Presentation
