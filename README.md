## Part 2 -- Tidying the tables
With comments see read_in.ipynb.

I really should have deleted the "total_sale" on the invoice table as that is a calculated value, but for the project I don't think we are allowed to delete data. Move about and modify yes but not delete.

## Part 3 -- Feed the database and do some SQL queries
Currently in the works.
